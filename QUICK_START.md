## üîë Key Concepts

### The Problem This Solves
Star wants to distribute DAMM v2 trading fee revenue to investors based on how many tokens they still have locked in Streamflow vesting contracts.

### The Solution (3 Parts)

1. **Honorary Position** - Program-owned LP position in DAMM v2 pool that only earns fees in quote token
2. **24h Distribution Crank** - Anyone can call once per day to distribute accumulated fees
3. **Pro-Rata to Locked** - Investors get share proportional to their still-locked amounts

### The Architecture (3 State Accounts)

```
PolicyConfig          ‚Üê Stores: investor_fee_share_bps, Y0, creator ATA, caps
      ‚Üì
InvestorFeePositionOwner  ‚Üê Owns the honorary DAMM v2 position
      ‚Üì
DailyProgress        ‚Üê Tracks: current day, pages processed, amounts distributed
```

### The Flow (Daily Cycle)

```
1. Trading happens ‚Üí Fees accumulate in honorary position (quote token only)
2. Crank called ‚Üí Claims fees, reads Streamflow locked amounts
3. Distribution ‚Üí Pays investors pro-rata, sends remainder to creator
4. Repeat next day
```

## üéì Understanding the Code

### Start Here
1. **State Accounts:** `programs/investor-fee-distributor/src/state/`
   - Read `policy_config.rs` first - This holds all the policy parameters
   - Then `daily_progress.rs` - This tracks the 24h window state
   - Then `investor_fee_position_owner.rs` - This owns the LP position

2. **Instructions:** `programs/investor-fee-distributor/src/instructions/`
   - `initialize_policy.rs` - ‚úÖ Complete (creates PolicyConfig)
   - `initialize_honorary_position.rs` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial (structure done, CPI pending)
   - `crank_distribution.rs` - ‚ùå Not created yet (but fully designed in docs)

3. **Supporting Files:**
   - `error.rs` - All possible errors
   - `events.rs` - All emitted events
   - `constants.rs` - PDA seeds and program IDs

### Key Design Patterns Used

**PDA Architecture:**
```rust
// All PDAs are deterministically derived from vault pubkey
PolicyConfig: seeds = [b"policy_config", vault]
InvestorFeePositionOwner: seeds = [b"investor_fee_pos_owner", vault]
DailyProgress: seeds = [b"daily_progress", vault]
```

**24-Hour Window:**
```rust
day_id = unix_timestamp / 86400  // Days since epoch
window_start = day_id * 86400    // Start of current 24h window
```

**Pro-Rata Distribution:**
```rust
f_locked = locked_total / Y0
investor_share_bps = min(policy_bps, floor(f_locked * 10000))
investor_fee = floor(total_fees * investor_share_bps / 10000)

for each investor:
    weight = investor_locked / locked_total
    payout = floor(investor_fee * weight)
```

## üîß What You Need to Complete

### Required Information

1. **From Meteora (for cp-amm integration):**
   - CP-AMM program IDL or Rust SDK
   - How to create a position via CPI
   - How to claim fees via CPI
   - Devnet pool with `collectFeeMode: 1`

2. **From Streamflow (for vesting integration):**
   - How to parse stream account data
   - How to calculate locked amount at timestamp t
   - Devnet vesting streams for testing

3. **From Star Team (for deployment):**
   - Final policy parameters:
     - `investor_fee_share_bps` (e.g., 7000 = 70%)
     - `Y0` value (total investor allocation at TGE)
     - `daily_cap_lamports` (optional)
     - `min_payout_lamports` (dust threshold)
     - Creator quote token ATA
   - List of investor Streamflow streams + ATAs
   - Vault identifier (Pubkey)

### Required Skills for Completion

- **Solana/Anchor Development:** Moderate (CPI calls, account parsing)
- **Testing:** Moderate (Bankrun test setup)
- **TypeScript:** Basic (SDK wrapper generation)

**Estimated Time:** 5-7 days for experienced Solana developer

## üèÉ Next Steps

### For Project Managers

1. **Review** [DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md](DELIVERY_SUMMARY.md) for executive overview
2. **Decide** on completion approach:
   - Complete internally with roadmap?
   - Get external program interfaces and collaborate?
   - Phase deployment (foundation first, then integration)?

### For Developers

1. **Read** [IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) in detail
2. **Study** the TODO comments in:
   - `instructions/initialize_honorary_position.rs`
   - (Future) `instructions/crank_distribution.rs`
3. **Gather** required resources (cp-amm SDK, Streamflow docs)
4. **Follow** the phase-by-phase completion guide

### For Integration Engineers

1. **Check** [README.md](README.md) "External Programs" section
2. **Research** cp-amm repository: https://github.com/MeteoraAg/damm-v2
3. **Test** with devnet pools before mainnet
4. **Validate** quote-only fee collection with small amounts

## üìä Completion Checklist

Use this to track remaining work:

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Add cp-amm dependency to Cargo.toml
- [ ] Complete `initialize_honorary_position` CPI calls
- [ ] Create `instructions/crank_distribution.rs`
- [ ] Implement Streamflow account parsing
- [ ] Add helper functions (math, utils)

### Testing
- [ ] Install test dependencies (bankrun)
- [ ] Write position initialization tests
- [ ] Write crank distribution tests
- [ ] Write edge case tests
- [ ] Test on devnet with real pool

### SDK & Docs
- [ ] Generate TypeScript SDK client
- [ ] Test SDK with examples
- [ ] Create deployment guide
- [ ] Update README with final examples

### Deployment
- [ ] Test on devnet end-to-end
- [ ] Security review
- [ ] Deploy to mainnet
- [ ] Initialize production accounts
- [ ] Set up crank service

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can I deploy this to devnet as-is?**
A: No, the `initialize_honorary_position` instruction needs cp-amm CPI integration first.

**Q: What's the main blocker to completion?**
A: CP-AMM program interface details. Once you have the SDK or IDL, integration is straightforward.

**Q: How hard is the remaining work?**
A: Moderate difficulty. If you have a working cp-amm CPI example, you can complete in 5-7 days.

**Q: Is the architecture sound?**
A: Yes. State accounts, math formulas, and protocol rules are production-ready. Only external integrations remain.

**Q: Can we use this in production when complete?**
A: Yes, but conduct a security audit first. The foundation follows Anchor best practices.

**Q: Where's the test suite?**
A: Not yet written, but the test plan is fully documented in IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md.
